## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are beneficial in implementing users needs into a program. They are beneficial because they encapsulate the user's requirements in an application. A well written user story addresses acceptance criteria written from a user's point of view. For example: "As a user, I would like to be able to x so that I can y".

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

One methodology I have integrated into my development is to break problems down into smaller, more manageable user stories. In doing so, it helps track progress towards the product vision, and makes it easier to stay on track during development.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Aside from having good technical skills, communication is one aspect that can sometimes be overlooked. Communication is a highly beneficial skill to have in order to be a good team member in software development. Being a team player, successful time management, collaboration, and adaptability are other traits that are found in a good team member.
